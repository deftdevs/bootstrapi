BootstrAPI is a fork of [ConfAPI](https://github.com/aservo/confapi-commons/), a series of plugins for providing additional REST API's for Atlassian products with focus on initial and declarative instance configuration (also referred to as "bootstrapping", hence the name).
ConfAPI was originally developed under the name of ASERVO Software GmbH.
This fork has been created by ConfAPI's [original maintainer](https://github.com/pathob).
